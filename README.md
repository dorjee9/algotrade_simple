# My Python Project

This project requires a few Python libraries. You can install them using `pip`.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed. You can check by running:

```bash
python --version
# Example output:
# Python 3.13.1
pip install yfinance pandas numpy matplotlib
python main.py

This version will **display correctly on GitHub**, with proper code blocks and headings.  

If you want, I can also **add badges for Python version and pip installs** to make it look more professional.
